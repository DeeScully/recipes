1.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with heavy-duty aluminum foil, crinkling it up to create deep creases. Shuck oysters, discard top shells, and place them on foil-lined baking sheet, using foil to keep them upright so that juices do not spill out.

2.
Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate.

3.
Place oysters directly over hot side of grill. Using 2 spoons, place 2 teaspoons (10ml) of compound butter inside each. Cover and cook until butter is melted and liquid is bubbling, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter lined with seaweed or moistened kosher salt (to keep oysters level; see note above) and serve immediately.
